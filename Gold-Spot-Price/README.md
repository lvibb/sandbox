Gold spot prices are somewhat fragmented since there are various sources. No standard price, which is why there is no exchange for this product. 

The goal of this project is to use machine learning concepts and utilize Deep learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network algorithm to predict gold spot pricing. Traders and Investors make educated guesses by analyzing data from several sources. LSTM can be built using Keras to learn and predict spot pricing using historical closing prices.
